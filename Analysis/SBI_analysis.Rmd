## Objectives

Two primary sources for metric obtions and preliniary metric response are [Shin et al. 2005](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/3/384) and [Rochet and Trinkle 2003](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f02-164).  


## Methods



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
