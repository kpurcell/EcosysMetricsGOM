  journal = {Reviews in Fisheries Science},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {57--95},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Abstract Fisheries of enclosed and semiâ€�enclosed seas provide the
	first basis for evaluating human impacts on marine ecosystems. These
	have become of serious concern before similar changes are detectable
	in oceanic systems, thus emphasizing their value as laboratories
	for comparative study of manâ€�induced changes. The paper discusses
	the relevance of the cline, oligoâ€�mesoâ€�euâ€�dysâ€�trophic to
	stressed marine systems, and focuses on impacts on fisheries of enhanced
	nutrient runoff, noting common features with marine systems subject
	to natural enrichment, but also with wellâ€�studied freshwater systems.
	It is suggested that under nutrient enrichment and heavy fishing,
	both â€œtop downâ€�; and â€œbottom upâ€�; trophic mechanisms act
	in synchrony to change the trophic chain, leading initially to increased
	fishery productivity of formerly oligotrophic systems, followed by
	more drastic and negative changes as nutrient input passes beyond
	a state that may be called mesotrophic. Nutrient enrichment and overfishing
	have similar and synergistic effects: a decline in diversity, an
	initial increase in productivity of benthic/demersal and pelagic
	food webs, then the progressive dominance of the production system
	by shortâ€�lived, especially pelagic, species. The separation of
	these two anthropogenic effects on semiâ€�enclosed seas is difficult
	and has been confounded by the synchronous growth of industrial fishing,
	and of downstream impacts of growing populations, industrialization
	and agroâ€�industry, and growing water usage, especially since World
	War {II.} A description of human impacts on several semiâ€�enclosed
	seas emphasizes the Marine Catchment Basin ({MCB)} concept, noting
	that ranking by the relative extents of catchment area and marine
	basin explains much of the observed impact. A systems approach to
	management of inland and coastal seas is suggested, with priority
	on the control of nutrient flows between terrestrial and aquatic
	systems, and the establishment of accurate statistical systems integrating
	fisheries and environmental data over whole basins and coastal seas.},

	cumulated, as in â€œk-dominanceâ€� curves, or separate k-dominance

  abstract = {Abstract Building on previous analyses suggesting that the composition
	of fishery landings reflects the effects of eutrophication on mobile
	fish and benthos, we examined landings composition in relation to
	nitrogen loading and the spatial extent of hypoxia in a cross-system
	comparison of 22 ecosystems. We hypothesized that explicit consideration
	of both N and hypoxia is important because nutrient enrichment has
	been shown to have contrasting direct and indirect effects on fisheries.
	Consistent with this premise, patterns in landings composition differed
	with respect to N load and the spatial extent of hypoxia. For example,
	the ratios of pelagic to benthic and demersal biomass in fishery
	landings ({P/D)} exhibited a decreasing trend across ecosystems with
	progressively higher N but were significantly and positively correlated
	with the spatial extent of hypoxia. The {P/D} ratios were particularly
	high in systems with extensive and persistent hypoxia and particularly
	low in several estuaries where purse seining is prohibited or not
	used. In analyses that considered all systems, benthic and demersal
	landings did not decrease at high N as predicted by previous conceptual
	models, and the negative association with the spatial extent of hypoxia
	was statistically significant only when the Black Sea was included
	in the analysis. Landings of pelagic planktivores did not vary with
	the spatial extent of hypoxia but were positively related to N for
	all systems combined and for semi-enclosed seas. The trophic and
	size composition of fishery landings were not related to N or hypoxia,
	perhaps because landings of large, high-trophic-level species are
	more influenced by fishery exploitation or practices that mask the
	effects of water quality. Our results suggest that the response of
	fisheries to eutrophication differs from prevailing paradigms, which
	do not clearly distinguish between nutrient and hypoxia effects on
	fishery landings and do not consider the important influence of fishing
	practices and regulations on patterns in landings data.},

	Nevertheless, to date it has been difficult to attribute habitat
	and benthic community changes to fishing effort at a spatial scale
	that is truly representative of commercial fishing activities.2.
	In this study we present convincing evidence that chronic bottom-fishing
	disturbance has caused significant and widespread changes in the
	structure of two distinct soft-sediment benthic assemblages and habitats.3.
	Our study compared the benthic fauna found in areas that have been
	exposed to either high or low levels of bottom-fishing disturbance
	over the past 10 years. We were able to validate the fishing effort
	data in some areas using scars in the shells of a long-lived bivalve
	mollusc (Glycymeris glycymeris) which result from fishing disturbance.
	Shell scars occurred most frequently in bivalves collected from the
	area of highest fishing effort.4. Multivariate analyses and the response
	of abundance/biomass curves indicated that chronic fishing has caused
	a shift from communities dominated by relatively sessile, emergent,
	high biomass species to communities dominated by infaunal, smaller-bodied
	fauna. Removal of emergent fauna has thus degraded the topographic
	complexity of seabed habitats in areas of high fishing effort. The
	communities within these areas currently may be in an alternative

  abstract = {Evaluation of the ecosystem effects of fishing presupposes that it
	is possible to measure the state of an ecosystem, detect differences
	among measures of its state, and determine if the differences are
	due to chance or impacts of fishing. Ecologists have developed or
	adopted four main classes of community/ecosystem metrics for such
	tasks: diversity and similarity indices, ordination methods, metrics
	of aggregate community properties, and metrics derived from ecosystem
	models. Each class is explained briefly, and guidance is given to
	the literature. Size spectra, k-dominance curves, and multi-dimensional
	scaling emerge as promising methods for these uses. Some modelling
	frameworks also may be useful, but more work is needed on sensitivity
	testing and development of independent theory for these models. The
	current theoretical basis for most ecosystem models assumes that
	competition structures the system being modelled. Problems with applying
	that framework to exploited marine systems are reviewed. Resampling
	methods are essential when testing for differences among community
	metrics. Practices for determining causality when ecosystem metrics
	change are reviewed, and additional knowledge and data necessary
	to link change to cause are highlighted.},

  abstract = {1. The development of ecosystem approaches to environmental management
	implies the need to account for multiple pressures on ecosystems.
	Trends in multiple metrics that respond differently to changes in
	major environmental pressures need to be combined to evaluate the
	impacts of fishing and environmental changes on fish communities.2.
	An exploited fish community is viewed as a three-level food chain
	in which the two upper levels, or functional groups, are targeted
	by fishing fleets, while the lowest level is subject to environmental
	variation. Qualitative modelling is used to predict changes at the
	two upper levels, that is, top-down vs. bottom-up perturbations.
	Abundance and length metrics are calculated from survey data for
	14 Mediterranean and East-Atlantic groundfish shelf communities at
	both population and functional group levels. The joint likelihood
	of time trends in metrics is used to evaluate the evidence for different
	causes of changes.3. A wide diversity of impacts is found to have
	equal evidence at the population level within each community. Consistency
	between the impacts identified and changes in pressures known from
	independent information is found at the functional group and community
	level. The results suggest that there is some compensation between
	species within functional groups.4. Synthesis and applications. The
	method can be used to conduct an integrated assessment of community
	dynamics subject to multiple pressures. Joint trends in metrics provide
	evidence of which known pressures are having an impact on the community,
	and thus, which management actions should be taken to mitigate these
	changes.},

	with increasing levels of disturbance can be determined by the abundance/biomass
	comparison ({ABC)} method. This response results from (i) a shift
	in the proportions of different phyla present in communities, some
	phyla having larger-bodied species than others, and (ii) a shift
	in the relative distributions of abundance and biomass among species
	within the Annelida (specifically Polychaeta) but not within any
	of the other major phyla (Mollusca, Crustacea, Echinodermata). The
	shift within polychaetes reflects the substitution of largerbodied
	by smaller-bodied species, and not a change in the average size of
	individuals within a species. In most instances the phyletic changes
	reinforce the trend in species substitutions within the polychaetes,
	to produce the overall {ABC} response, but in some cases they may
	work against each other. Indications of pollution or disturbance
	detected by this method should be viewed with caution if the species
	responsible for the polluted configurations are not polychaetes.
	These observations provide an aid to interpretation of the {ABC}

	The temporal pattern in the {ABC} curves and the W-statistic for

	upon declining trawl effort in the same region. The {ABC} method
	shows promise as a guide for assessing the effects of fishing on
