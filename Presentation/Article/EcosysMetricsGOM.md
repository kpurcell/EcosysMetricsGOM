RH: Fish imports eutrophication effects community dynamics  

## Abstract 
(words target)



* the current status of fisheries is bad and declining.
managing effort has not resulted in recovery of stocks
* Marine Protected Areas, specifically non-take reserves have been offered as a solution and show to be effective, however questions of their broader effect remain.
* There are few examples of reduced fishing effort in which effort reduction was not tied to reductions in resource abundance.
* The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is one such example.  A previously dominant fishery which has been greatly reduced due to economnic rather than biological mechanisms.
* Here we examine the relative impact of environmental and anthropogenic disturbance on the demersal nekton community of the Gulf of Mexico.  
	1. what is the relationship between changes in fishery extractive activities and community and populations dynamics.
	2. What role does secondary eutrophicaion and hypoxia have to do with overall community change?

### Introduce Gulf
The Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) hosts a rich marine community....fertile cresent...etc etc.  In recent decades has come under intense disturbance and is currently one of the more disturbed...


Eutrophication and harvest, have a disproportionately strong effect on the demersal fish community through coastal hypoxia and physical stress of harvest.  The demersal environment of the north-western Gulf of Mexico is a unique environment to evalute the dichotomy betweeen top-down and bottom-up disturbance processes and to correlate long-term monitoring of these disturbancs with community and populations level responses within the ecosystem.  The northern Gulf of Mexico is home to one of the most wide spread bottom water hypoxia evernts in the western hemisphere and the aerial extent of this event has been monitored for almost thirty years (1985-presnt).

### Fishing effort

In addition to hypoxia, the north-western Gulf is home to one of the largest and most valuable fisheries in the US.  Domestic shrimp fisheries landed ~302 million pounds in 2012, ranking eighth among US fishery species by volume and ranking third by value with revenues of ~$490 million dollars [Current Fishery Statistics 2012].  The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery represented roughly 68% of landings and 79% of the value of the entire domestic shrimp fishery with landings in excess of 208 million pounds and revenues of $387 million dollars [Cite the statistics book].  Maybe more on effort deployment and extent??

However, profitability of this fishery began to falter in 2001 driven primarily by increased global trade in shrimp products and increasing diesel fuel prices, creating challenging economic conditions for the Gulf shrimp fishery [@travis2004update].  From 1980 to 2003 world export of both fresh and frozen shrimp increased approximately 3.23 billion pounds, meanwhile the price per pound of shrimp products dropped roughly 54% due to deflation during the same period [@keithly2008southeast].  The ex-vessl, or dock side price, of shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico dropped 40% from 2000-2003 [@keithly2008southeast; @jones2012big].  Coupled with increases in fuel costs, which increased between 20-30% between 2000-2003, the economic performance of the Gulf shrimp fishery has been in a sharp decline for over a decade [@jones2012big] and is resulting in a dramatic reductions in fishing effort .  

Perhaps quickly introduce previous studies examining fishing effort effects on communities? or maybe above in the general section.



### Question paragraph
This decline in effort which is not motivated by limitations in resource abundance but rather exogenous economic drivers provides us with an valuable opportunity to evaluate the community response to a release from predation while also allowing for an examination of the relative contribution of fishing effort and environmental perturbation on the demersal nekton community of a LME.  

The objective of this study was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in demersal nekton community of the northern Gulf of Mexico.  The nwGOM is a highly disturbed environment experiencing eutrophication, intense patterns of harvest over the last 30 years.  

The spatial and temporal differences in bottom water hypoxia, in comparison to the rather uniform distribution shrimp fishery effort allows for the comparison of two region and two seasons providing a quai-experimental study design which allows for improved understanding of the mechanisms driving community dynamics in this LME???

Additionally, the limited spatial distribution of MPAs pose challenges in evaluating the effects of a release from harvest.  

## Methods  
### Data Sets:  
The Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) survey is a hydrographic trawl survey which has been conducted in the north-western Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) (-88 to -97 longitude, 3-100 meters depth) since 1982 and has operated in a standardized format since 1987 [@Eldridge1988Southeast].  The survey collects environmental (e.g., temperatures, salinity, dissolved oxygen, depth) and biological data (e.g., species presence, abundance) at point locations chosen based on a stratified random sampling design.  In the 31 years the SEAMAP survey has operated it has utilized 2261 unique taxonomic entities representing 747 genus and 1341 species.  To more manageably examine the diversity and dynamics of this marine community we evaluated a list of 60 species and 4 genus which represent ~90% of the total sampled biomass over 25 years (1987-2011) of the SEAMAP survey.  To avoid the systematic size bias derived from a biomass metric our list was created by examining the cumulative biomass contributions of all 2261 entities divided into three primary categories: pelagic, demersal and invertebrates.  From each of these three lists approximately 20 species were chosen from each representing 88% of demersal, 95% of pelagic and 97% of invertebrate sampled biomass.  By dividing the full list of taxonomically identified entities into these three categories and choosing representatives from each category we assured that our composite list of 4 genus and 60 species  was representative of both the overall environment sampled and the entirety of the biomass sampled by the SEAMAP survey.  The 4 independent genus designations (*Cynoscion*, *Loligo*, *Squilla*, *Solenocera*) were included due to their contribution to overall biomass and their prominent role as troublesome identification categories.  We examined only data post-1987 because prior to 1987 SEAMAP samplings methodologies are inconsistent in sampling time of day.  Additionally, our analysis only considers data for the north-western Gulf of Mexico (west of -88 longitude), due to our interest in the relative contribution of hypoxia and fishing pressure on community dynamics and because this is the region of the Gulf most often effected by coastal hypoxia [@rabalais2002gulf].  While the SEAMAP database includes abundance and taxonomic specifics, additional species specific habitat occupancy (ie., pelagic, demersal) data was derived from FishBase (http://fishbase.org) [@Froese2010FishBase].  

To evaluate the relationship between community dynamics and the two primary offshore environmental disturbances (hypoxia, fishing pressure) within the northwestern Gulf region we employed data from both fishery-independent and dependent sources.  To quantify the effect of hypoxia we used data derived from the annual mid-summer shelf wide hydrographic survey cruise that has been conducted by Louisiana University Marine Consortium (LUMCON) since 1985.  A primary objective of the summer LUMCON cruise is to generate an estimate of the aerial extent of hypoxia in the northwestern Gulf during mid-summer (CITATION).  Fishing pressure, or more specifically, commercial shrimp trawling effort on the Louisiana and Texas coastal shelves was quantified using fishery landings data which are archived by the National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS) Galveston Laboratory, Texas.  This database is a fishery-dependent data set which is a summary of monthly landings and effort data for the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery.  Fishing effort data for the shrimp fishery is not measured directly but is estimated, based on non-random interviews conducted by NMFS port agents.  We utilized annual aggregated fishing effort along both the Louisiana and Texas shelves as a covariate and potential driver in the temporal dynamics of community dynamics [citations].  

### Regression Analysis  
Our first effort was to examine the temporal dynamics in the annual estimates of both abundance and biomass of our 64 selected taxonomic groups and compare those dynamics to the two primary offshore environmental disturbances within the north-western Gulf.  We used breakpoint analysis to identify important temporal changes along the 25 year time series used within this analysis.  Breakpoint analysis, employs piecewise regression, or "broken-stick", models to iteratively fit a series of regression models, and can be utilized to identify critical thresholds (CITS) or important change-points within a time series (XXXX).  Our analysis employed a single sharp-break linear regression approach, which identified an ideal breakpoint for each time series by iteratively fitting a series of regression models with possible breakpoints ranging from 1990-2010.  Optimal models were selected based on which model had the lowest mean square error (MSE) (XXXX).  

### Abundance Matrix:  
Abundance and biomass are clear markers of disturbance or regime change in most aquatic environments (CITATIONS).  However, due to the nature and environmental effects of a traditional trawl fishery mean that not only are fishery target species effected but often much of the available demersal biomass is effected as well.  Bycatch within a Gulf trawl fishery is of growing concern, so much as to be mandated for examination by the Magnuson IMPORTANCE OF BYCATCH  

To evaluate annual patterns of abundance with respect to bycatch status we classified each of our 64 taxonomic entities according to the nature of their bycatch relationship within the Gulf shrimp trawl fishery.  A recent study of fishery observer data for both the South Atlantic and the US Gulf of Mexico Penaeid shrimp fisheries [@Scott-Denton2012Characterization] used observer data from > 10000 individual tows and approximately 5200 sea days to characterize bycatch within the shrimp fishery.  We classified each of our taxonomic groups into one of four bycatch categories (target, high, rare, never) based on the proportion of biomass that species or group contributed to total bycatch biomass within this recent study.  The three species (*F. aztecus*, *L. setiferus*, *F. duorarum*) which are primary targets of the shrimp fishery in the north-western Gulf were identified as TARGET species, within the HIGH group were any taxonomic entities represented by ≥ 0.1 percent of total biomass in the study, groups with the RARE designation consisted of < 0.1 percent of the total biomass, and finally the NEVER category consisted of species which were part of our taxonomic entities but were absent from bycatch characterization study.  To visualize these relationships we employed a utilized the mvtsplot R package [@Peng2008method] to create a 4 panel matrix plot in which high abundance is represented by green and low abundance is red, each time series is color metrically independent, and each panel represents a different category of bycatch association.  

### Community metrics:  
Under the framework of ecosystem based management a number of studies have examined the correlation between metrics of community composition and a wide array of ecosystem disturbance regimes [@Fulton2005which; @rochet2010changes; @rice2000evaluating; Link citations etc].  We chose four metrics of community composition to describe and examine patterns of spatial and temporal variation within the north-western Gulf demersal nekton community.  We calculated a 25 year time series for Margalef's index (*D*), Pielou's eveness (*J*), and two of Hill's numbers *N1* and *N2* based on SEAMAP abundance data for our 64 taxonomic entities.  Using the methods outlined above we developed broken-stick regression models for each community time series and determined a break point ($\alpha$) in the time series based on the lowest MSE.  

### Pelagic to Demersal Ratio:  
The proportion of pelagic relative to demersal biomass in fishery landings is considered a metric sensitive to eutrophication [@Caddy1993Toward;@de2000pelagic;@Hondorp2010Eutrophication].  Conceptually, the P:D ratio is derived from the differential response of fishery stocks to increased nutrients within a system [@caddy1998have].  More specifically in partially enclosed systems, eutrophication will tend to degrade benthic habitat resulting in decreased demersal landings and elevated pelagic-demersal ratios [@Hondorp2010Eutrophication].  Previous studies have found positive correlations between P:D ratio and chlorophyll-a concentrations within systems in both Europe and the Mediterranean [@caddy2000marine;@de2000pelagic].  To evaluate the effect of annual hypoxia on community dynamics we examined temporal and spatial dynamics in P:D ratio within the northwestern Gulf.  Biomass data for the 64 sampled biomass time series were classified as either pelagic or demersal based on species specific habitat occupancy.  The annual P:D ratios were calculated as the quotient of the annual aggregated pelagic and demersal biomasses for all survey stations summed across both the Louisiana and Texas shelves [citation].  We also calculated the P:D ratio as a shelf wide metric including all stations for the entire north-western Gulf.  

### Abundance Biomass Comparison (ABC) curves:  
The application of Abundance Biomass Comparison (ABC) curves to the study of disturbance within an ecosystem has an established history within marine benthic systems [@Warwick1986new] especially with respect to pollution driven perturbations [@warwick1987detection;@Warwick1994Relearning].  ABC curves are a derivative of *k*-dominance curves [@lambshead1983detection; @greenstreet1996fishing], the theoretical basis of which is derived from principles of intermediate disturbance hypothesis [@Connell1978Diversity] and r- and k-selection theory [@Pianka1970r] and has been previously reviewed [@Warwick1994Relearning; @Yemane2005Exploring].  Specifically, ABC analysis involves the comparison of two superimposed *k*-dominance, or cumulative ranked, curves for both abundance and biomass within a system over a given time period [@Clarke1990Comparisons].  The difference between the curves is calculated as the Warwick statistic (*W*) with negative values indicating a biomass curve that lies below the abundance curve, and represents relatively disturbed systems [@Warwick1986new;@Yemane2005Exploring].  Recently, the application of ABC curves has been applied to the examination of fishing pressure and its impacts on fish assemblages [@Bianchi2001dynamics; @Blanchard2004Fishing; @DeMartini2008Differences; @Jouffre2005Assessing; @Kaiser2000Chronic; @Yemane2005Exploring].    

In the north-western Gulf fishing effort from the commercial shrimp fishery is widely distributed across both the Louisiana and Texas coastal shelves (Supp. Figure 1: yearly plots for ELB data).  To evaluate the impact of this effort on demersal fish assembledges we used SEAMAP survey data on both the abundance and biomass of our previously described 64 taxonomic groups and aggregated them spatially based on their location on either the Louisiana or Texas shelf.  The value of this spatial comparison lies in the difference between the perturbation mechanisms operating on the respective coastal shelves.  While fishing effort is a consistent feature across the two coastal shelves, hypoxia is predominately a condition found in Louisiana coastal waters with limited exceptions in the northern most waters of the Texas coastal shelf (Rabalais, Bianchi see SpatialEff_MS citations for the same statement).  Dominance curves were generated for each year of survey data (1987-2011) for both the Louisiana and Texas regions using the Dominance plot routines in the software package PRIMER v6 [@Clarke2001PRIMER], and *W* statistics were derived from these curves for each year for the Louisiana and Texas shelves, receptively.  


## Results
 
Overall trends in biomass and abundance within our 64 taxonomic entities during the 27 years of data evaluated in this study showed their highest values early in the survey, 1992 for biomass (Figure 1A) and 1987 for abundance (Figure 1B), with the lowest time series values occurring in 2000 for both measures.  Both biomass and abundance display positive trends since 2000, with values in 2011 representing 75% and 56% of the highest recorded values for biomass and abundance, respectively.  In contrast, time series values for our two ecosystem drivers, fishing effort and hypoxia, show differing temporal patterns of variation with fishing effort showing decline and hypoxia showing an increase during the period of observation.  Fishing effort was highest in 1987 at a value of 2.4 x 10^5^ (days) and was relatively stable at values around 2.0 x 10^5^ (days) until 2000 (Figure 1C).  After 2000, we begin to observe declining shrimping effort with a precipitous decline in 2003 that culminates in a minimum value of 6.0 x 10^4^ (days) in 2010, a ~75% reduction in fishing effort over 7 years (Figure 1C).  The aerial extent of hypoxia showed lower values early in the time series with the average trend stabilizing at approximately 160,000 km^2^ in 1993 with a small rate of increase and considerable inter-annual variability throughout the rest of the time series (Figure 1D).  
  
To better understand to role of individual species or groups to the overall temporal variability of biomass within the northern Gulf we calculated a biomass time series for each of the 64 taxonomic entities considered in our study.  Individual time series were grouped into four groups reflecting their bycatch relationship within the Gulf shrimp fishery. Of the four groups observed fishery targets consisted of 4.1% of survey biomass, with high (64.4%) rare (18.2%) and non-bycatch (13.2%) species making up the other 95.8% of overall survey biomass.  Our comparison found that for the three target species *P. aztecus*, *P. setiferus*, and *P. duorarum* biomass values were low until 2003 (Figure 2A) at which point biomass values begin to increase for each of the three target species.  The time series for high-incidence bycatch species display an general pattern of decline with considerable inter-annual variability among the 16 taxonomic entities (Figure 2B).  The lowest biomass values for this group occur in the late 1990s until the early-2000s at which time many of the species in this group show increasing biomass.  The biomass time series for both low-incidence bycatch (Figure 2C) and non-bycatch (Figure 2D) species show very similar patterns of overall reduction in biomass throughout the period of observation.  With only a few notable exceptions(e.g. *Larimus fasciatus*, *Amusium papyraceum*) most species considered in these two final categories show little sign of increasing biomass over the observed period.  

### Diversity Metric Trends
Differences in the abundance and biomass of the taxonomic groups examined indicates the possibility of changes in community structure that could be resulting from changing environmental forces in the northern Gulf ecosystem.  We examined 4 metrics of community structure and diversity for both the Louisiana and Texas coastal shelf during the summer and fall seasons.  We observed an overall decrease for all metrics in each region and season combination during the examined time series (Figure 3).  The rate of decrease for each metric is greater post-2000 in all region season combinations with the exception of the Texas shelf during the fall months (9-12) where decreasing trends seemd to begin earlier (1995-2000) (Figure 3D).  

Annual community metrics for the Louisiana shelf displayed contrasting patterns of temporal variation during the early period of the time series (1987-1995).  Specifically, we observed increasing trends for metrics during the summer months on the Louisiana shelf, peaking ~1995 and beginning to decline with abrupt declines between 2000-2004 (Figure 3A).  By contrast, the Louisiana shelf during the fall showed decreasing measures of community structure early in the survey (1987-1995) after which there was period of stability (1995-2000) following which we observe abrupt declines similar to that seen in the summer months (Figure 3B).  While community metrics for the Texas shelf did display an overall decrease during the observed time series, the magnitude of change was considerably smaller than observed for the Louisina shelf (Figure 3C,D).  In the summer months on the Texas shelf we observed a subtle pattern of increase for all metrics, with the possible exception of species richness which remained relatively stable (Figure 3C).  This increasing trend peaks in 2000 after which they decline throughout the observed period (Figure 3C). During the fall months the Texas shelf displayed greater inter-annual variation for each metric and while there were increases in observed metrics during individual years, average trends showed only limited increases early in the time series and then the common pattern of decrease in the post-2000 years (Figure 3D). Species richness, displayed a decreasing trend during the early portion of the time series (1987-2000) after which it stabilized, this was unique in comparison to all other region and season combinations (Figure 3D). 

### Breakpoint analysis
** Rework this paragraph to have the effects (abudance and biomass) first and the drivers second. Then continue with metrics in the second paragraph to show that not only does biomass and abudance follow these trends but so do metrics of overall community dynamics and structure.

Both ecosystem drivers displayed broken stick shape curves (Figure 1A, 1B) that suggested the suitability of using piecewise regression analysis to explore differences in temporal trends for each time series.  A piecewise regression analysis for both ecosystem driver (fishing effort and hypoxia) determined that fishery effort was best modelled with a break point $\alpha$ = 2001 (*R^2^* = 0.999, *F* = 1.223e^4^, *p* = <0.001) while area of hypoxia was best modelled with an break point in 1996 (*R^2^* = 0.995, *F* = 1226.0, *p*= <0.001 ).  Further, our ecosystem drivers were also modeled with piecewise regression and breakpoints for biomass and abundance were identified in 2002 (*R^2^*=0.995, *F*=1109.0, *p*= <0.001) and 2000 (*R^2^*=0.997, *F*=1969.0, *p*= <0.001), respectively.  

Breakpoint analysis was also used to identify significant changes in the temporal patterns of the 4 community metrics for both regions (Louisiana and Texas) during both the summer and fall seasons (Table 1).  All break point models were significant and ranged in $\alpha$ value from 1995 to 2004 with *R^2^* values all exceeding 0.97 (range = 0.972-0.999).  The earliest break point values occurred on the Texas shelf during the Fall season (1995-2000), for all other region/season combinations break points were identified within a 4 year window (1999-2004) with 17 of the 18 indicators breaking on or after 2000 (Table 1).  

### Pelagic to demersal biomass ratio
The ratio of pelagic to demersal biomass for the north-western Gulf showed an overall decrease during the 25 year time series (Figure 4) with a high of 0.30 (1987) to a low value of 0.09 (2008). We observed a distinct separation in P:D ratio values between regions, with Texas showing consistently higher P:D values (0.13-0.62) relative to Louisiana (0.04-0.24) and therefore greater proportions of pelagic biomass across the entire time series in the Texas region (Figure 4).  Inter-annual variability is greater overall on the Texas shelf (variance = 0.016) in comparison to P:D values for the Louisiana coast (variance = 0.003).  The average rate of change was similar between regions prior to 1994 after which time the Texas shelf shows a temporay increase (1995-2000) which was followed by an increased rate of decline.  The difference between regional P:D ratios shows a decreasing trend during the 25 year time period observed, with the differnce between regions in 2011 only ~10% of the greatest difference (0.50) in 1996 (Figure 4).  The greater similarity between the P:D time series for the north-western Gulf and the Louisiana shelf reflects the dominance of the Louisiana shelf (62.4%) in the overall biomass for the entire survey.  
 
### ABC curves (*W*-statistics)
To further examine the effect of ecosystem disturbance on the northwestern Gulf community we calculated a *W*-statistic time series for both the Louisiana and Texas coastal shelves based on biomass and abundance values for our 64 taxonomic groups (Figure 5).  Over the entire 30 year time series the Louisiana shelf sustained a lower average *W* value (0.009) relative to the Texas shelf (0.050), indicating a higher level of disturbance within that region.  The range of *W* values was similar between the Louisiana (-0.109-0.259) and Texas (-0.116-0.294) shelves, however the relationship between abundance and biomass on the Louisiana shelf was negative 13 of the 30 years examined, while the Texas shelf displayed negative relationships in only 5 of those 30 years (Figure 5). Additionally, 3^rd^ degree polynomial regression lines showed differing patterns of change early in the time series with Texas values declining while values on the Louisiana shelf were relatively stable (Figure 5, solid line).  This relationship changed in the mid to late 1990s with both regions begining to show patterns of increase for both regions begining in the late 90s and increasing at comparable rates (Figure 5).  


## Discussion

###Paragraph: about abundance and biomass trends?
Describe overall findings

@Watson2013global - "Global marine yield halved as fishing intensity redoubles"
	-might be cool to mention that opportunities to examine the effect of large-scale reductions in fishing effort or intensity are rare.
	- especially in conditions driven by economic rather than biological limitations. (look for previous copy on this perhaps up in the Intro)
	
	
	

from [@henriques2008development] p1917 "since a decrease in abundance or biomass is the first "response parameter" of a fish community in the presence of an impact" [@keough1991causality; @harrison2004multi-metric] 

Similar to the guild approach [@elliot2007guild], our "fishing guilds" were defined based on the relationship between a given taxnomic entity and its catch or bycatch relationship with the Gulf shrimp fishery.  We 
  Might need to dip into MPA literature for discussion material??
  
  
  
### Paragraph about Matrix plot
Comparison of temporal patterns in species biomass (Figure 2) based on species association with the shrimp fishery allows us to isolate the impact of fishing effort on species specific demersal abundance.  

* Fishing targets displayed low biomass until 2003 after which biomass showed increasing trends
* High incidence bycatch species also showed recovery post 2000
* Non and low incidence bycatch spcies show little sign of change post-2000.  A few examples could be examined if there is good theories.



###Paragraph: Community diversity trends with respect to fishing and eutrophication.

~ Diversity/disturbance papers and possible theoretical tie ins?

@Bianchi2000impact -  "impact of fishing on size comp and diversity of demersal fish comm"

@Handley2014importance - "The importance of benchmarking habitat structure and composition for..."
	- might be cool to add a sentence about the value of our results in terms of benchmarking impacts and that previous bench marks would have made monitoring more impactful.
	
 * Overall decline in community metrics across the time series
 * The severity of decline is more extensive in Louisiana than on Texas shelf
 * Rate of decline is higher post-2000
 * Seasonal consistency in Texas in contrast to seasonal differences on Louisiana shelf
 


###Paragraph: Follow up on the community metrics trends with a discussion of the temporal correlation findings from the break point analysis.

* ecosystem drivers indicated breaks at 1996 (hypoxia) and 2001 (fishing effort).
* Abudance and biomass both display break points at 2002 and 2000 (check these) respectively
* Almost all of the indicators displayed break points on or after 2000 with a single exception which occurred on the Texas region calling into question any association with hypoxia (and the 1996) time break.


###Paragraph: Pelagic-demersal ratio findings:

* Overall decline in P:D ratio
* Rate of change varies across time-series including a period 1995-2000 where Texas saw increases
* Regional differences in P:D ratio and rates of change

  Hondorp
  Caddy
Pelagic-to-demersal ratio:
Additionally, a recent study by Hondorp et al [-@hondorp2010eutrophication] examined landings composition and water quality data for 22 different coastal ecosystems including estuaries, coastal seas, and semi-enclosed basins.  While Hondorp et al [-@hondorp2010eutrophication] reported indications that fishery practices (gear) and management could affect patterns of landings composition, they found that systems with extensive eutrophication and hypoxia displayed high P:D ratios.  

Maybe work in a tie to the shifting baselines problem.  Many reduction in fishing explotation are the result of reductions in abundance or the collapse of stocks or large-scale regiem shifts in the ecosystem, however changes the Gulf ecosystem 


### Paragraph: Disucssing the the ABC curve analysis within the broader framework of literature

The relationship between biomass and abundance is one that has a long history in the literature.  The disparity is an indicator of disturbance.  

* Lower W-statistic values for Louisiana than Texas
* Increases in temporal W-statistic trends differ between Louisiana and Texas
* 

### Paragraph: Summarize what we learned and how it fits into the bigger shit

### Paragraph: Managmenet? or previous points bigger framework  

Be sure to mention [@Jordan2010summer] analysis of summer fish communities in the nGOM estuaries.  "The used community data from trawl samples in >100 estuaries, bayous and coastal lagoons to develop indicators of ecol condition"  The constructed a fish community index (FCI) and compared their index to a number of ecosystem disturbances...
